# DataVisualization-JAVA-Project
In this Java project, we will develop Data Visualization System In Java that will create a pie chart for the information entered by the user. 
# Objectives
The objectives for building a Data Visualization System in Java may vary depending on the specific needs and goals of the project. However, some common objectives for building such a system might include the following:

1. To implement the tables that contains the item names & amount & using that information generate a pie chart from the class JfreeChart.

2. To improve data analysis and decision-making: A data visualization system can help users to understand complex data better, identify trends and patterns, and make more informed decisions.

3. To enhance data communication: A well-designed visualization can help to communicate complex data in a more accessible and understandable way, making it easier to share insights with others.

4. To automate data processing and visualization tasks: A data visualization system can automate data processing and visualization tasks, reducing the time and effort required to analyze and communicate data.

5. To provide real-time data monitoring: A data visualization system can be used to monitor data in real-time, providing users with up-to-date information and allowing them to respond quickly to changes.

6. To enable customization and flexibility: A data visualization system built in Java can be highly customizable and flexible, allowing users to create visualizations that meet their specific needs and requirements.
